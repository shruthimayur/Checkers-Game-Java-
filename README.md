# Checkers-Game-Java-
This application is a clone of the Checkers game implemented using Java. This application is a 2-player game where the player who has to start is given clues on what all moves are possible. Once a player makes a move, the other player has to play and the first player would be forbidden to make a move and vice versa. At any given instance the application indicates which player has to make a move by highlighting the possible moves. The application also covers the "king" feature of the checkers game. Please refer to the Checkers game rules for a complete understanding.
